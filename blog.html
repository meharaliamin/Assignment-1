        <h2>What Is Motivation, Really?</h2>
        <p>ou likely know of people who have been doing the same thing for years and seem to not have any problem staying stagnant. Whether it be in their marriage, job, or personal endeavors, they seem to be getting along just fine without progressing towards anything “better.”

            On the other hand, I’m sure you also know of individuals who focus on the positive, goals setting and are constantly pushing themselves to greater heights. Be it promotions at work, building a family, celebrating marriage milestones, traveling more, or going to school again, these individuals seem to constantly progress towards something that improves or enhances their life.</p>
            <h2>How to Get Motivated Daily</h2>
            <p>Why not take some time today and do a quick reflection of where you’re at now? Take one aspect of your life that you’d like to progress further in.

                For example, it may be your current job. Start with your why. Write down your reasons for why you’re in the job that you’re in.
                
                Then, think about your Motivation Core: your Purpose. Write down what it is within your job that gives you meaning, and what are some things that will help push you forward in life.</p>
                <h2>Final Thoughts on Staying Motivated</h2>
                <p>Happiness doesn’t need to be a vague term or illusion that you’re constantly chasing after with no end in sight. By finding your true motivation, you’ll be one step closer to realizing your happiness and finding meaning in everything you do.

                    You may have tried many solutions to help you stay motivated and found that none of them really have any impact. That’s because they bring about incremental changes only, and permanent change requires a holistic approach. It requires more than just focusing on one area of your life or changing one part of your routine or actions.
                    
                    You want to make a fundamental change, but it feels like big, unknown territory that you can’t afford to venture into at this point in your life.
                    
                    The truth is, taking your life to the next stage doesn’t have to be this complicated. So, if you’d like to take the first step to achieving your life purpose, the time to learn how to find motivation is now!</p>
